# Synopsis

The node.js hydna library is a straight-forward implementation of the hydna
binary protocol. The module has been closely modeled to the native node.js
modules and the usage pattern should come naturally to developers using other
node.js modules. The module does not have any external dependencies.

Latest compatible node.js-version: 0.2.0
